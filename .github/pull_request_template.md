# Contributing to ⚡️ mlx-benchmark ⚡️

Thanks for opening this PR! A few checks before submission:

- [ ] I provide a description of the benchmark by running `python mlx_benchmark/get_cpu_gpu_config.py`
- [ ] I verify that my benchmark ran on a newer version of MLX, or that my device is not yet integrated within the benchmark
